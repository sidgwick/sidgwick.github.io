pjax is a jQuery plugin that allows quick website navigation by combining ajax
and pushState. It works by sending a special request to the server every time
a link is clicked or a form is submitted. The server sends back the content
that needs to be updated, pjax replaces old content with new content and
pushes the new URL to browser history, without the need to update the whole
page.

> Regular requests download the whole page. Pjax can ask the server to send
> only the required part of the content.

Yii2 framework has a Pjax widget that helps you pjaxify your website in just
one easy step.

1. Add one line in the beginning of your view.

   ```php
   <?php
   use yii\widgets\Pjax;
   ?>
   ```

2. Add two lines around the content that needs partial updating.

   ```php
   <?php Pjax::begin(); ?>
   Content that needs to be updated
   <?php Pjax::end(); ?>
   ```

You can further configure the widget. Choose which links and which forms will
be hadled by Pjax; whether the new URL should be pushed to browser history,
replaced or left as is; the timeout after which the page will be reloaded in
case there’s no response; Pjax can also scroll the page for you.

## Yii2 Pjax Examples

You can download the source code of the examples from this tutorial from
GitHub.

### Refresh

Let’s look at the simplest example first. We have some data on our page that
we want to refresh by clicking a link. For simplicity’s sake we’ll use the
current server time as our dynamic data.
[Demo](http://blog.neattutorials.com/examples/pjax/web/site/index).

![demo image](http://i2.wp.com/blog.neattutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/yii2-pjax-example-refresh-button.png?resize=409%2C150)

First lets tell the view which part of the page we want to update dynamically.
This is achieved by placing the widgets tags `<?php Pjax::begin(); ?>` and
`<?php Pjax::end(); ?>` around the content. Every link and every form between
these tags will now trigger a pjax request.

```php
<?php Pjax::begin(); ?>
<?= Html::a("Refresh", ['site/index'], ['class' => 'btn btn-lg btn-primary']) ?>
<h1>Current time: <?= $time ?></h1>
<?php Pjax::end(); ?>
```

Our action only provides the $time to the view and renders the view.

```php
public function actionIndex()
{
    return $this->render('index', ['time' => date('H:i:s')]);
}
```

That’s it. Whenever the widget will detect a pjax request it will serve the
required part of the content instead of the whole page.

Don’t forget to add `use yii\widgets\Pjax;` in your view.

### Auto refresh

While we’re on topic of refreshing lets take our previous code and make it
refresh the content automatically after a number of seconds. Demo. To achieve
this we’ll add a couple of lines of javascript to our view.

```php
<?php
$script = <<< JS
$(document).ready(function() {
    setInterval(function(){
         $("#refreshButton").click();
    }, 3000);
});
JS;

$this->registerJs($script);
?>
```

This code will trigger a click event for our refresh button every three
seconds. Note that we need to specify an id `'id' => 'refreshButton'` for our
button for this to work. If you want to you can hide the button by setting its
CSS class to hidden `'class' => 'hidden'`.

### Navigation

In this example we will have several links pointing to different controller
actions that will return different results. Our view will look almost the same
as in the previous examples, except now it will have two links/buttons.
[Demo](http://i1.wp.com/blog.neattutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/yii2-pjax-navigation-example.png?resize=294%2C123).

```php
<?php Pjax::begin(); ?>
<?= Html::a("Show Time", ['site/time'], ['class' => 'btn btn-lg btn-primary']) ?>
<?= Html::a("Show Date", ['site/date'], ['class' => 'btn btn-lg btn-success']) ?>
<h1>It's: <?= $response ?></h1>
<?php Pjax::end(); ?>
```

Here are the two actions that will render the different views. It’s as simple
as that.

```php
public function actionTime()
{
    return $this->render('time-date', ['response' => date('H:i:s')]);
}

public function actionDate()
{
    return $this->render('time-date', ['response' => date('Y-M-d')]);
}
```

### Multiple blocks

You can use the widget in several places on one page. When a link inside of
one of these blocks will be clicked it only that block will be updated.
[Demo](http://blog.neattutorials.com/examples/pjax/web/site/multiple).

![Multiple blocks](http://i2.wp.com/blog.neattutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/yii2-pjax-exmple-multiple-widgets.png?resize=660%2C79)

Here is our view. Notice how the widget is used in two places inside one view.

```php
<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
    <?php Pjax::begin(); ?>
    <?= Html::a("Generate Random String", ['site/multiple'], ['class' => 'btn btn-lg btn-primary']) ?>
    <h3><?= $randomString ?></h3>
    <?php Pjax::end(); ?>
</div>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6">
    <?php Pjax::begin(); ?>
    <?= Html::a("Generate Random Key", ['site/multiple'], ['class' => 'btn btn-lg btn-primary']) ?>
    <h3><?= $randomKey ?><h3>
    <?php Pjax::end(); ?>
</div>
```

Here is the corresponding action. We will also require `yii\base\Security` for
this example.

```php
public function actionMultiple()
{
    $security = new Security();
    $randomString = $security->generateRandomString();
    $randomKey = $security->generateRandomKey();
    return $this->render('multiple', [
        'randomString' => $randomString,
        'randomKey' => $randomKey,
    ]);
}
```

This isn’t the best solution. Every time one of the buttons is clicked both,
the random string and the random key, are generated, but we use only one of
them for the purpose of updating the view. To fix this we can add two more
actions and two additional child views, each for the corresponding function
(string generation and key generation). Then we could call the child views
from our main view

```php
<?= $this->render(‘_randomKey’, [‘randomKey’ => $randomKey]); ?>
```

and render them directly from our additional actions.

### Form submission

Submitting a form is a great use case for the Pjax widget. For this example we
will be hashing strings so it will take time for the server to respond.
[Demo](http://blog.neattutorials.com/examples/pjax/web/site/form-submission).

![Form submission](http://i1.wp.com/blog.neattutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/yii2-pjax-form-submission-example.png?resize=660%2C86)

Our view will include the Pjax widget, a form, a text input field and a submit
button.

```php
<?php Pjax::begin(); ?>
<?= Html::beginForm(['site/form-submission'], 'post', ['data-pjax' => '', 'class' => 'form-inline']); ?>
<?= Html::input('text', 'string', Yii::$app->request->post('string'), ['class' => 'form-control']) ?>
<?= Html::submitButton('Hash String', ['class' => 'btn btn-lg btn-primary', 'name' => 'hash-button']) ?>
<?= Html::endForm() ?>
<h3><?= $stringHash ?></h3>
<?php Pjax::end(); ?>
```

Here is our action. Nothing out of the ordinary.

```php
public function actionFormSubmission()
{
    $security = new Security();
    $string = Yii::$app->request->post('string');
    $stringHash = '';
    if (!is_null($string)) {
        $stringHash = $security->generatePasswordHash($string);
    }

    return $this->render('form-submission', ['stringHash' => $stringHash,]);
}
```

Since our forms method is POST, pushState won’t trigger and the URL won’t be
updated.

### Disabling pushState

Sometimes you will want to disable pushState manually. In this example part of
the view will be updated, but the URL will stay the same.
[Demo](http://blog.neattutorials.com/examples/pjax/web/site/vote).

![Disabling pushState](http://i0.wp.com/blog.neattutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/yii2-pjax-example-disable-pushstate.png?resize=131%2C126)

The view will only have two links and the vote count. To make this simple we
will just store the number of votes in the session. Voting systems are beyond
the scope of this tutorial. To configure the widget we will pass an array as a
parameter in its begin method.

```php
<?php Pjax::begin(['enablePushState' => false]); ?>
<?= Html::a('', ['site/upvote'], ['class' => 'btn btn-lg btn-warning glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up']) ?>
<?= Html::a('', ['site/downvote'], ['class' => 'btn btn-lg btn-primary glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-down']) ?>
<h1><?= Yii::$app->session->get('votes', 0) ?></h1>
<?php Pjax::end(); ?>
```

The controller will feature three actions. One will simply render the view.
The other two actions will process the upvote and downvote pjax requests.

```php
public function actionVote()
{
    return $this->render('vote');
}

public function actionUpvote()
{
    $votes = Yii::$app->session->get('votes', 0);
    Yii::$app->session->set('votes', ++$votes);
    return $this->render('vote');
}

public function actionDownvote()
{
    $votes = Yii::$app->session->get('votes', 0);
    Yii::$app->session->set('votes', --$votes);
    return $this->render('vote');
}
```

### GridView sorting and pagination

Yii2 GridView has been specifically designed to allow seamless sorting,
filtering and pagination with the Pjax widget. Simply put the GridView widget
inside the Pjax widget in your view. No modifications for the controller are
necessary.
[Demo](http://blog.neattutorials.com/examples/pjax/web/php-version/index).

![GridView sorting and pagination](http://i2.wp.com/blog.neattutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/yii2-pjax-gridview-example.png?resize=660%2C861)

```php
<?php Pjax::begin(); ?>
<?= GridView::widget([
    'dataProvider' => $dataProvider,
    'filterModel' => $searchModel,
    'columns' => [
        ['class' => 'yii\grid\SerialColumn'],

        'id',
        'branch:ntext',
        'version:ntext',
        'release_date:ntext',

        [
            'class' => 'yii\grid\ActionColumn',
            'template' => '{view}',
        ],
    ],
]); ?>
<?php Pjax::end(); ?>
```

## Conclusion

The Pjax widget is great for some use cases. If something goes wrong or the
request will take too much time it can reload the page completely. You can
still open links in new tabs or windows. It’s a great replacement for
`CHtml::ajaxLink` from Yii 1.x. Search engines don’t have to render JavaScript
to crawl websites that utilize pjax. You can customize it further using
JavaScript.

It’s not very efficient because it has to send the required data alongside
with HTML code. Depending on your needs, you can make a more efficient web
application using a JavaScript MVC framework(e.g. AngularJS), jQuery or even
plain JavaScript. All you have to do is separate the views from the data,
then, with the help of Ajax, deliver the views as HTML and the data as JSON.
